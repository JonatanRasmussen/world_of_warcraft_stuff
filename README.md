This is the code for my personal project: WoW TWW S1 Dungeon Drop Chances.

The code scrapes data from Wowhead and then generates a CSV file containing all the loot available for each World of Warcraft class in the new season, as well as the "drop chances" based on what other items are available from each boss' loot table.

See this Google Spreadsheet: todo-add-this
I posted the final result on Reddit: todo-add-this
